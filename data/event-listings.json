    "description":"<p>“The writing of Kelly Luce is beautifully stark and simple, and at the same time playful, earthy, and violent. She’s unique, a natural born writer, and Pull Me Under is a strange and very appealing novel, a journey to Japan and the primal scene of the main character's self―which, like a volcano, may have already blown its top.” ―Rachel Kushner</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Kelly Luce's unforgettable debut is an elegant mystery, a tender story of family and forgiveness, an unsettling depiction of the darkness we each carry inside, and a hymn to Japan. Noodle shops, summer festivals, ancient temples, and the lush landscape of rural Shikoku burst to life in these pages. From its first sentence, Pull Me Under grabs the reader and doesn't let go.&#34; ―Sarah Bird, author of Above the East China Sea</p><p><br></p><p>“As Rio moves deeper into the painful secrets of the past, secrets that nearly destroyed her in childhood and are threatening to undo her once again, I could not stop turning the pages of Kelly Luce’s hypnotic debut. Pull Me Under is a fierce and suspenseful exploration of the profoundly mysterious nature of identity, written with precise and spectacular beauty. Kelly Luce is one of our most thrilling new talents.” ―Laura van den Berg</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Kelly Luce’s debut novel is an urgent and wise story about the many disparate identities a life can hold, but it is also an astonishing example of all that a novel can encompass. By turns, Pull Me Under is a finely crafted mystery, a portrait of a fractured family, an evocative travelogue, an aching coming-of-age tale, and an insightful contemplation of our inescapable histories in an increasingly globalized and digitized culture. In this novel, Luce offers many poignant, page-turning pleasures, but her greatest gift to the reader is her revelation of how a single life, a single mind, a single, artful book can contain multitudes.&#34; ―Stefan Merrill Block</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;This is a suspense novel with a female protagonist that gets more right about women than so many others I've read in the past few years.&#34; ―NPR</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;Revelatory&#34; ―Elle</p><p><br></p><p>&#34;[Pull Me Under] will bewitch you.&#34; ―O Magazine</p>",

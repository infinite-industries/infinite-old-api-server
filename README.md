# Getting Started
1. git clone git@github.com:infinite-industries/infinite.git
2. cd into `infinite` and run `npm install`
3. copy the file .env.sample to .env and update the environment variables
   + The most important values to change are the ones regarding Postgres. You should have a postgres instance running with a database inside of it called 'infinite-api'. The POSTGRES_USER should be set to a superuser (for now, this should be changed for production but is necessary for migrations/seeds to run now)
4. if this is your first time running it:
    + execute `npm run  && setup-create-db && npm run setup-dev`
5. execute `npm run start-dev`

In the future after pulling down new changes instead of running `npm run setup-dev`, instead execute `npm run setup-refresh-db`. This will drop the contents of and rebuild the existing database with the latest schemas  and default data.

# Dependencies
+ NodeJS 8.x.x
+ Postgres 9.x.x

# NPM Commands
   * start: starts the api server
   * start-dev: starts the api server and re-starts when files are changed
   * start-docker: runs setup-dev then starts the api server
   * test: runs tests (not yet implemented)
   * watchify: [Not Used Anymore],
   * deploy: deploys to production assuming you have valid certs,
   * createTestDevKey: creates a hard-coded dev key that can be used for tests,
   * setup-create-db: creates the database (must be done with a postgres super user),
   * setup-drop-db: drops the database,
   * setup-migrate-db: runs migrations to create the correct schema in the database,
   * setup-dev: run this the first time you start the project; it creates all the schemas and populates the database with test dev key and test data loaded from the production json
   * setup-refresh-db: run this after pulling in changes, it drops the database, re-creates it and runs setup-dev to make sure your environment is up to date,
   * setup-seed-from-prod: loads data from the json file driving the current production environment

# Proposed Flow

<!-- 1. *Get Random Artwork* Client makes an API call for an artwork ID. Unique ID is returned, client can check if the artwork has been shown already. If not, make another query for artwork by ID and proceed to show to user.

2. *Event Announcement* Client makes an API call for art event by {country, state, city, neighborhood, date-range} if specific scope yelds results an array of one to n members is returned.   -->

<!-- ### Get Event info by ID

### Get Random Artwork ID
### Register webhook
### Create a new event -->

### Example event create post
`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "event": {"title":"foo", "slug":"xyz" }, "apikey":"48e80bde-aec4-44bb-89e9-01b4a90092cd"}' http://localhost:3003/events`

### Example Verify Event ###
`curl -X PUT http://localhost:3003/events/verify/522479a0-c1ab-11e7-910d-794911741001?apikey=2019529e-7f8c-44f9-8996-f52a88b2a314`

### Import Latest JSON FILE ###
npm run importEvents

### Create an Event List ###
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "eventList": {"list_name":"chris list" }, "apikey":"2019529e-7f8c-44f9-8996-f52a88b2a314"}' \
http://localhost:3003/event-lists
```

### Add a List to an Existing Event ###
```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "apikey":"2019529e-7f8c-44f9-8996-f52a88b2a314"}' \

```

* Where `bc1afcd0-e37a-11e7-aa97-8d2f2418d66e` is an existing list
* And `9bfb1e30-d3d5-11e7-86f9-b75399ffb386` is an existing event

### Hey, Dev to Get Test Data In MONGO ###
`npm run dropDB && npm run setupDevEnv`


### Run Postgres through Docker ####
`docker run -p5432:5432 --name infinite-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=xxx -d postgres`

- https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/
- Connect from host with `psql -h localhost -U postgres`
- Note migrations need super user access to run, we probably wan't to run migrations and the application against two different postgres users
